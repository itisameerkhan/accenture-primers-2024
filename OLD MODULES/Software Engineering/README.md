## ⭐ Waterfall model

The Waterfall Model is one of the earliest and most straightforward methodologies used in software engineering for the development of systems and software. It is a linear and sequential approach where progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through several phases. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, with no overlap.

> [!NOTE]
> The waterfall model is useful in situations where the project requirements are well-defined and the project goals are clear. It is often used for large-scale projects with long timelines, where there is little room for error and the project stakeholders need to have a high level of confidence in the outcome.
